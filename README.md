# Ddos-attacks-detection
Dataset-1.csv file is data taken from a online source about network data collected in a college.
Dataset-2.csv file is data that we have collected based on our own network traffic.

For Dataset-2 click http://205.174.165.80/CICDataset/CICDDoS2019/

Both csv files must be placed in same directory as the .ipynb file to run correctly.

We have compared the DDos detection rate by using 3 different models (KNN, Logistic regression and random forest) on existing datasets as well as live data.
